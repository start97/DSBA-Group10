Video surveillance (CCTV) is a technology that is nowadays deeply woven into the everyday life of many people as one tends to expect it in many varied circumstances (Ossola, 2019). The rationale behind the installation of these systems seems to be very clear for governments. For example, on Buffalo’s (NY) open data website, one can read that “the City of Buffalo deploys a real-time, citywide video surveillance system to augment the public safety efforts of the Buffalo Police Department”. Yet, the development of this new technology, is not exempt from any controversy. For instance, many observers claim that the expansion of video surveillance poses an unregulated threat to privacy (ACLU, 2021). Still, many people seem to be willing to accept this loss in privacy as the surge in video surveillance makes them feel safer (Madden & Rainie, 2015).

Throughout this research, we challenge the widespread belief that people who have “nothing to hide" should be content with the expansion of CCTV networks as the latter makes them safer (Madden & Rainie, 2015). Indeed, on top of many privacy issues linked with this surge in video surveillance systems, one might legitimately ask the question whether these cameras actually make people safer?

The goal of this project in the first phase is to investigate the crime deterrent potential of CCTVs in an Amercian city. This potential will also be compared to the different types of crime that are committed in this area. Over a second phase, the dispersion of CCTVs within the city will be investigated. Indeed, according to some researches, mass surveillance has a stronger impact on communities already disadvantaged by their poverty, race, religion, ethnicity, or immigration status (Gellman & Adler-Bell, 2017). We would like to see whether our data enables us to validate or invalidate this theory. It would also be extremely interesting, even though challenging, to see whether the installation of surveillance systems could potentially create even more pernicious issues such as crime displacements (Waples, Gill & Fisher, 2009).

In sum we argue that, in a world where CCTVs and other surveillance systems are flourishing, it might be beneficial to take a step back and question both the efficacy and the implementation design of such technologies, since they are often portrayed by different stakeholders as miraculous solutions to very complex issues.


### Backgrounds

*Augustin:* Augustin obtained a degree in Business Administration at the University of St-Gallen where he had the opportunity to develop a strong interest in digital business ethics. He wrote his bachelor’s thesis on the privacy implications of the use of fear appeals in home surveillance devices’ marketing strategy.

*Marine:* Marine made a bachelor in Law at the UBO (Université de Bretagne-Occidentale). She is presently into the Master DCS (Droit, Criminalité et Sécurité des technologies de l'information) at the Unversity of Lausanne. Last year, she had the opportunity to take a data protection course and learn more about cyber security and crime in general.

*Daniel:* Daniel is an exchange student from Koblenz, Germany. Daniel obtained a bachelor's degree in Business Administration/Management at the WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management, Germany. He is currently pursuing a Master of Management with focusing on family businesses, entrepreneurship and data science in his courses. Interestingly regarding this project, Daniel spend several months in the United states after high school and thus he can relate to the topic about police violence and crimes in the US. 

### Motivations

Firstly, from our respective backgrounds, we derive a strong interest in new technologies and privacy. We believe that every person is entitled to the fundamental right to privacy. Unfortunately, one observes an increasing tendency of governments and other stakeholders (e.g. businesses such as GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple)) to take more and more control in our daily lives through digital technologies such as cameras, computers or smartphones. For these reasons it is interesting to ask ourselves if this massive collection of our data leads to more security or more restrictions of our freedom. 

Secondly, if we look at European law like the GDPR, collection and processing of our data must be proportionate to the purpose of that processing. Therefore, it is of our interest to determine if these applications are the same in the United States and to see if the installation of cameras, with the objective of security, really allows to reduce crime and to make a city more secure. 

Thirdly, it must also be said that crime and the legislative discussions regarding the right to wear a gun in the United-States are fascinating. At first, it seems as if the freedom to carry a gun makes the US more prone to crimes such as mass shootings. To verify or falsify our hypotheses, we also want to see through the datasets we obtained, what kind of crime prevails in American cities and how it evolves according to the districts and their particularities.

### Research questions

1)    Does the presence of CCTVs in a given area actually deter crime?
2)    What types of crimes may be deterred by surveillance cameras?
3)    Is the impact of CCTV installation on crime reduction higher/lower/same in higher income neighborhoods compared to lower income neighborhoods?
4)    Are there more public cameras in lower income/higher unemployment areas compared to higher income/employment areas? (Does the government respect privacy issues depending on your income level?) 
5)    Do we observe crime displacement issues caused by the installation of CCTV in some neighbourhoods?
