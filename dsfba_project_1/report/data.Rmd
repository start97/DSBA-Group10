### Data source

We considered investigating three US cities such as Buffalo, Washington and Baltimore. This preliminary selection was based on the fact that these were the only three cities for which we found interesting CCTV data. After a more thorough analysis of the data sets we could retrieve for each of these respective cities, we ended up choosing Baltimore as their CCTV data set seemed to be the most complete and interesting and because their open data portal offered a lot of seemingly interesting other information.
<br>
We have five main raw data sets. All data sets were retrieved on Baltimore government's open data portal. We found data about crimes committed in Baltimore, CCTV location in the city and poverty level. We also found a data set showing the reference boundaries of the Community Statistical Area geographies. The latter will certainly be helpful to match each data set's observations together. Finally, we also obtained a data set containing the respective population of each community.

### Raw Data sets

### 2.3 Poverty Data set

This data set provides information about the percent of family households living below the poverty line. This indicator measures the percentage of households whose income fell below the poverty threshold out of all households in an area. 

Federal and state governments use such estimates to allocate funds to local communities. Local communities use these estimates to identify the number of individuals or families eligible for various programs. These information will be useful for us to study the dispersion of CCTVs within Baltimore in comparison to the poverty level in a given area.  This data set contains 55 observations, one percentage for each community statistical area. There seems to only be one NA. The most relevant variables are the following: 

  + **CSA2010** = name of the community statistical area. The Baltimore Data Collaborative and the Baltimore City Department of Planning divided Baltimore into 56 CSAs. These 56 units combine Census Bureau geographies together in ways that match Baltimore’s understanding of community boundaries, and are used in social planning.

  + **hhpov15 - hhpov19** = each these five column contains the percent of Family Households Living Below the Poverty Line for a given year, from 2015 to 2019.

  + **Shape_Area - Shape_Length** = standard fields to determine the area and the perimeter of a polygon

### 2.4 Area Data set

This data set provides information about the Community Statistical Area geographies for Baltimore City. Based on aggregations of Census tract (2010) geographies. It will serve as a geographical point of reference for us to match each data set's observations together. This data set contains 56 observations, one for each of area. The most relevant variables are the following:

```{r results='markup'}

knitr::kable(cbind(c("**community**","**neigh**","**tracts**"),c(" $→$ name of the community statistical area.

### 2.5 Population Data set

This data set provides information about the population in each Community Statistical Area. Information about the total population in 2010 and 2020 are provided. It will be useful to calculate values per capita in each community. The most relevant variables are the following:

  + **community** = name of the community statistical area. The Baltimore Data Collaborative and the Baltimore City Department of Planning divided Baltimore into 56 CSAs. These 56 units combine Census Bureau geographies together in ways that match Baltimore’s understanding of community boundaries, and are used in social planning.

### 2.6 Data Wrangling

#### 2.6.1 Data Wrangling: Area

Here, the main goal is the transformation of the area data set into a new data set, which contains one observation per **neighborhood**. Indeed, it is important to distinguish neighborhoods which are smaller areas from communities, which are larger and often contain several neighborhoods. We achieve that by first creating a new data set with each neighborhood being assigned to a community using  `separate_rows` and second establishing a new columns with lower case letter for later merge. To do so, we combine the `mutate` function with  `tolower` which convert the uppercase letters of string to a lowercase string.

```{r echo=TRUE}

area_data2 <- separate_rows(area_data, Neigh, sep = ", ") #Creation of a new data set with each neighborhood being assigned to an area

area_data2 <- mutate(area_data2,neigh=tolower(Neigh)) #Creation of new column with lower case letters

```

#### 2.6.2 Data Wrangling: Crime

As neighborhood names in the crime data set contain higher case letter, we again use the `tolower` function to be able to match this data set with the area data set. We then do so by using `left_join`. Next, we use the `anti_join` function to understand which observation has not matched. The outcome shows all the neighborhoods which did not match. As shown below, the issues mostly come from spelling difference (e.g.: Mount written Mt.). As we have very few observations which do not match, we change the names manually.

  + mount washington $→$ Mt. Washington 
  + carroll - camden industrial area $→$ Caroll-Camden Industrial Area 
  + patterson park neighborhood $→$ Patterson Park 
  + glenham-belhar $→$ Glenham-Belford 
  + new southwest/mount clare $→$ Hollins Market 
  + mount winans $→$ Mt.Winans 
  + rosemont homeowners/tenants $→$ Rosemont 
  + broening manor $→$ O'Donnell Heights 
  + boyd-booth $→$ Booth-boyd 
  + lower herring run park $→$ Herring Run Park 
  + mt pleasant park $→$ Mt. Pleasant Park 
  
```{r}

crime_data <- mutate(crime_data,neigh=tolower(crime_data$Neighborhood)) #Creation of new column with lower case letters

crime_data_with_areas <- crime_data %>% 
  left_join(area_data2,by="neigh") #We create a new data sets that contains the name of the area in which the crime was committed

crime_data_NAs <- crime_data %>% 
  anti_join(area_data2,
            by="neigh") #Here is the list of all the NAs we have

unique(crime_data_NAs$neigh) #We see that we have very few unassigned names, we can change this by hand.

crime_data["neigh"][crime_data["neigh"]=="mount washington"] <- "mt. washington"
crime_data["neigh"][crime_data["neigh"]=="carroll - camden industrial area"] <- "caroll-camden industrial area"
crime_data["neigh"][crime_data["neigh"]=="patterson park neighborhood"] <- "patterson park"
crime_data["neigh"][crime_data["neigh"]=="glenham-belhar"] <- "glenham-belford"
crime_data["neigh"][crime_data["neigh"]=="new southwest/mount clare"] <- "hollins market"
crime_data["neigh"][crime_data["neigh"]=="mount winans"] <- "mt. winans"
crime_data["neigh"][crime_data["neigh"]=="rosemont homeowners/tenants"] <- "rosemont"
crime_data["neigh"][crime_data["neigh"]=="broening manor"] <- "o'donnell heights"
crime_data["neigh"][crime_data["neigh"]=="boyd-booth"] <- "booth-boyd"
crime_data["neigh"][crime_data["neigh"]=="lower herring run park"] <- "herring run park"
crime_data["neigh"][crime_data["neigh"]=="mt pleasant park"] <- "mt. pleasant park"

#We got rid of the 764 remaining observations which had no information about neighbourhood

```
  
We get rid of the 764 remaining observations which had no information about neighborhood. This represent a very tiny portion of our total number of observations. Then, we use the `semi join` function to create the final data sets which in total is basically the same data set as the original one minus the 764 observations that we got rid of. 

We also want to get rid of observations dating back before the year 2000 as the the Baltimore CCTV program started in the year 2000 (Youth.gov, n.d). We first check the structure of the data set using the `str` function. We notice that the CrimeDateTime column is not a date. We change that and finally filter the information we want to keep using `filter`.

```{r}

crime_data_with_areas <- crime_data %>% 
 semi_join(area_data2,by="neigh") %>% 
  left_join(area_data2,by="neigh") #Here we have the final data frame with a community for each crime

str(crime_data_with_areas) # We see that the crime CrimeDateTime column is not a date. We thus convert it.

crime_data_with_areas$CrimeDateTime <-  as.Date(crime_data_with_areas$CrimeDateTime)

crime_data_with_areas <- crime_data_with_areas %>%  filter(CrimeDateTime >= as.Date("2000-01-01")) #We had 24 observations that dates back to before the year 2000 and 24 observation with no date. We only select crime committed after 2000 as the CCTV program in Baltimore started in 2000.

```

#### 2.6.3 Data Wrangling: Poverty

56 areas are included in the standard community statistical area system. However, within these 56 statistical areas is also jail included. For the poverty data however, we only have 55 statistical areas provided, as we obviously do not have data about poverty in jail. To solve this inconsistency, we add a new line. Moreover we needed to fill a missing value for South Baltimore in the year 2019: we decided to take the average of the past years as it seemed relatively stable over the past years.

```{r}
poverty_data <- rbind(poverty_data,list(56,"Unassigned -- Jail",0,0,0,0,0,0,0))

poverty_data[48,7] <- c(poverty_data[48,3],poverty_data[48,4],poverty_data[48,5],poverty_data[48,6]) %>% mean() #The poverty level of South Baltimore in 19 was missing. This area's level over the past years seems to be stable (always one of the richest area), that's why we compute the mean of the past 4 years to replace the missing value.

```

#### 2.6.4 Data Wrangling: CCTV

This data set seems rather tidy, we will mostly use the first two columns which contain information about the location of each CCTV. Therefore, we only need to make sure to not have any missing values in these two columns. We do so by combining the `which`and the `is.na` function and by filtering for potential empty observations. By doing so we ensure that we have no NAs neither empty values and so that our data set is tidy.

```{r results='markup'}

which(is.na(cctv_data$X))
which(is.na(cctv_data$Y))
filter(cctv_data, cctv_data$X=="")
filter(cctv_data, cctv_data$Y=="") 

```
