Research objective

*1)  Does the presence of CCTVs in a given area actually deter crime?*

* Goal: Yes-or-no answer.Yes, in neighborhoods x,y,z. No, in neighborhoods x,y,z. 
* Communicate goal: Show map of Baltimore with neighborhoods (graphical respresentation). Either completely red (no deterring of crime), or green (deterring of crime) or yellow (no effect).
* Steps: 
* Needed packages: tidyverse, leaflet, 
* Things to consider: 


2)  What types of crimes may be deterred by surveillance cameras?

* Goal: Crime reduction by type. 
* Communicate goal: Crime type overview. For each crime show reduction (effect of installation). Summarize on which three crimes it actually has most significant impact. 
* Steps: 
* Needed packages: 
* Things to consider: 


3)  Is the impact of CCTV installation on crime reduction higher/lower/same in higher income neighborhoods compared to lower income
    neighborhoods?
    
* Goal: Comparison impact on neighborhood + Root causes
* Communicate goal: Show top 3 impacted neighborhoods, show top 3 less impacted neighborhoods, explain three reasons why difference (compenents x,y,z)
* Steps: 
* Needed packages: 
* Things to consider: 

4)  Are there more public cameras in lower income/higher unemployment areas compared to higher income/employment areas? (Does the government         respect privacy issues depending on your income level?) 

* Goal:
