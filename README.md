## Welcome to our project ! This is our knit guideline. 

If you encounter any issue while knitting our project, it might potentially be because you are missing one of the package we used. Our file is made so that it loads all the required packages, yet, if you miss any of these package, you will encounter an issue.

Here is the list of all the packages required to properly knit our file.

* For project organisation : "here";

* For data wrangling : "tidyverse", "lubridate","data.table","lubridate";

* For the rest of the report : "ggrepel", "gghighlight", "patchwork", "maps", "scales","sp","rgdal","cartogram","tmap","grid","sf","car","FactoMineR","factoextra","pdp", # for plotting
  "knitr", "kableExtra", "stargazer", "bookdown", "rmarkdown". 
  
You can install the potentially missing package by using on of these two methods:

* Solution 1 : Click manually on "Packages" in the right of RStudio. Then, select "Install". In the research bar, type the name of the missing package, select it in the scrolling panel, and finalise the process by clicking on "Install". 

* Solution 2 : Enter this following piece of code in your RStudio console : install.packages("NAME OF THE PACKAGE TO INSTALL").
